# Yomichan for Chrome #

Yomichan for Chrome turns your browser into a tool for building Japanese language literacy by helping you to decipher
texts which would be otherwise too difficult tackle. This extension was inspired in part by
[Rikaichan](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rikaichan/) and
[Rikaikun](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rikaikun/jipdnfibhldikgcjhfnomkfpcebammhp?hl=en), but it stands
apart in its goal of being a all-encompassing learning tool as opposed to a mere browser-based dictionary. It is the
natural evolution of the [Yomichan](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan) plugin that I developed for [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) when I
was starting to learn Japanese back in 2011.

## Installation ##

The most straightforward way to install this extension is to download it from its listing in the [Chrome Web
Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yomichan/ogmnaimimemjmbakcfefmnahgdfhfami). If you are a developer, you
can also clone the [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/FooSoft/yomichan-chrome), provided that you have have [Git
LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) installed (it is required to download the included dictionary files).

If you wish to make use of the *AnkiConnect* functionality to create Japanese flash cards directly from your browser,
you must install the [AnkiConnect](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect) extension first. If you already have
[Yomichan](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan) installed, AnkiConnect can be used after it is enabled in the plugin preferences.

2.  Hold down the <kbd>Shift</kbd> or the middle mouse button while you move your mouse over Japanese text.
3.  Resize the definition window by dragging the bottom right corner of the window.
